# webterm

This directory was the separate `steamos-config` repo. It holds webterm and
`home-units.service`, which the `steamos` variant of `~/dotfiles/install.sh`
installs with its `webterm` and `home_units` features.

## What it is

webterm gives you a real shell in the browser. It runs
[ttyd](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd), a single static binary (about
1.3 MB) that serves an [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) page and connects it
to your shell. systemd starts it the first time you open the page and stops
it once no browser has been connected for 30 s.

There is nothing to compile and no Node, npm, Python or root access needed.
That's handy on SteamOS, where the root filesystem is read-only.

## How it works

```
browser ⇄ 127.0.0.1:3000 ──► webterm.socket            (always listening)
                              │ first connection starts
                              ▼
                             webterm.service          systemd-socket-proxyd
                              │ --exit-idle-time=30s
                              ▼ $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/webterm.sock
                             webterm-ttyd.service     ttyd ⇄ pty ⇄ your shell
```

- **`webterm.socket`** listens on `127.0.0.1:3000`. It's the only part that
  runs all the time, and systemd itself does the listening.
- **`webterm.service`** runs `systemd-socket-proxyd`, which ships with
  systemd. ttyd can't take over a socket that systemd opened, so the proxy
  takes it and forwards each connection to ttyd. After 30 s with no open
  connections, the proxy exits. That covers both a closed tab and a page
  that never connected.
- **`webterm-ttyd.service`** runs ttyd on a UNIX socket in your private
  runtime directory, so other local users can't reach it. It has
  `StopWhenUnneeded=yes`, so it stops when the proxy exits. The socket keeps
  listening, so your next visit starts everything again.
- ttyd pings each browser every 10 s, so dead connections (a browser crash,
  a laptop suspend) get closed and the idle timer can run.

A backend is needed because a web page can't start processes. Only a local
program can start a shell and attach it to a terminal.

## Requirements

All of these come with a stock SteamOS or Arch install:

- Linux with systemd (including `/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-socket-proxyd`)
- `git`, `curl`, `sha256sum`, `tar`, `xz`
- x86_64 or aarch64 (the CPU types ttyd publishes static builds for)
- Optional: `tmux`, to [keep work running](#keeping-work-with-tmux)

## Quick start

```sh
~/dotfiles/install.sh --variant steamos --font --webterm --home_units
~/dotfiles/install.sh --variant steamos --webterm   # just ttyd and the units
```

`--all` installs these along with the rest of the `steamos` variant.

When it finishes, it prints your URL, which looks like
`http://localhost:3000/<token>/`. Bookmark it. The token is explained in
[Security](#security). To update, `git pull` in `~/dotfiles` and run the
installer again.

What gets installed:

- **Font** (`--font`): installs JetBrainsMono Nerd Font
  (Nerd Fonts v3.4.0) into
  `~/.local/share/fonts/JetBrainsMonoNerdFont/`, after checking its SHA-256.
  It does nothing if `fc-list` already lists the font.
- **ttyd and units** (`--webterm`): downloads ttyd 1.7.7 to `steamos/bin/ttyd`
  (git ignores it), checks it against a pinned SHA-256, and installs the units
  into `~/.config/systemd/user/`. Everything stays in your home directory, so
  SteamOS updates don't remove it.
- **home-units** (`--home_units`): only with an encrypted home directory; see
  [Encrypted home directory](#encrypted-home-directory-dirlock).

`--dry-run` prints what would change. To remove webterm:

```sh
systemctl --user disable --now webterm.socket
systemctl --user stop webterm.service webterm-ttyd.service
rm -f ~/.config/systemd/user/webterm{.socket,.service,-ttyd.service}
rm -rf ~/.local/state/webterm
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

Your URL token stays in `~/.config/webterm/env`.

## Configuration

| Setting      | Where                                                     | Default            |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Idle timeout | `WEBTERM_IDLE` in `webterm.service`                       | `30s`              |
| Font         | `WEBTERM_FONT` in `webterm-ttyd.service` or the env file  | JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono |
| URL token    | `WEBTERM_TOKEN` in `~/.config/webterm/env`                | random, 32 hex     |
| Port         | `ListenStream` in `steamos/systemd/webterm.socket`        | `127.0.0.1:3000`   |

Change the environment settings with a drop-in, for example:

```sh
systemctl --user edit webterm.service       # [Service] Environment=WEBTERM_IDLE=5min
```

To change the port, edit `steamos/systemd/webterm.socket`. After any change, apply it
as described in [Applying changes](#applying-changes).

## Applying changes

```sh
~/dotfiles/install.sh --variant steamos --webterm
```

You don't need to close the browser. The script:

1. re-renders the units from the repo (so edited templates and a `git pull`
   take effect),
2. reloads systemd, and
3. restarts the proxy and ttyd, but only if they're running. If they aren't,
   the next visit starts them with the new settings anyway.

`~/.config/webterm/env` is read again on every start, so changes there apply
too.

Open tabs show "Reconnecting..." and come back by themselves with the new
settings (font, title and so on), without a page reload. Each tab gets a
**fresh shell**, so anything running in a bare shell ends. tmux sessions
survive; see [Keeping work with tmux](#keeping-work-with-tmux).

The exception is the token. After changing it, open the new URL; tabs still
on the old one can't reconnect.

## Font

The terminal uses **JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono** by default. The Mono
variant draws Nerd Font icons one cell wide, so prompts line up in the grid.

How it works:

- ttyd's `-t key=value` passes any option straight to xterm.js, so the unit
  runs `-t "fontFamily=${WEBTERM_FONT}"`. No custom build is needed.
- The page only names the font. The browser draws it from fonts installed
  on the machine it runs on, which is the Deck here. That's why the `font`
  feature installs it. Flatpak browsers (the default on SteamOS) should also
  see `~/.local/share/fonts`.
- If the browser was already open when the font was installed, restart it.
  Until then it uses the next font in the list.

To use a different font, add it to `~/.config/webterm/env` and restart.
Open tabs switch fonts when they reconnect:

```sh
echo 'WEBTERM_FONT=JetBrainsMonoNL Nerd Font Mono, monospace' >> ~/.config/webterm/env
~/dotfiles/install.sh --variant steamos --webterm
```

The value can be any CSS font list without an `=`. Run
`fc-list : family | grep -i nerd` to see the exact names that are installed.

## Browser tab shortcuts

xterm.js turns most Ctrl combos into terminal input and stops the browser
from handling them. Chrome keeps some tab shortcuts for itself, but in
fullscreen (F11) it lets the page handle every shortcut first, so the
terminal would eat them. webterm hands these back to the browser:

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd> to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>9</kbd>
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>PgUp</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>PgDn</kbd>
- <kbd>F11</kbd>, so it leaves fullscreen instead of reaching the shell

Every other key, like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>,
still goes to the shell.

How it works:

- ttyd has no option for this, but `-I` serves a custom `index.html`. The
  repo keeps only the script to add, `steamos/web/tab-keys.html`. It listens for
  keys before xterm.js does and stops them from reaching it, without
  cancelling the browser's own handling.
- The stock page bundles ttyd's browser client, which must match the ttyd
  binary. So when the units are installed (`--webterm`), `steamos/bin/webterm-index` starts a throwaway ttyd on a
  temporary UNIX socket, fetches its page, appends the script and writes
  `~/.local/state/webterm/index-<sha256 of steamos/bin/ttyd>.html`.
- `webterm-ttyd.service` runs ttyd through `steamos/bin/webterm-ttyd`, which hashes
  `steamos/bin/ttyd` on every start and adds `-I` only if a page for that hash exists. If not, ttyd serves its stock
  page: the terminal works, but without the tab shortcuts in fullscreen.
  `journalctl --user -u webterm-ttyd.service` then shows a warning, and
  `~/dotfiles/install.sh --variant steamos --webterm` builds the page again.

After changing `steamos/web/tab-keys.html`, apply it as described in
[Applying changes](#applying-changes) and reload open tabs.

## Encrypted home directory (dirlock)

With an encrypted home directory, webterm doesn't start after a reboot. The
user manager (`systemd --user`) starts before dirlock unlocks the home
directory, so it can't see `~/.config/systemd/user` and skips
`webterm.socket`. `systemctl --user status webterm.socket` then shows
`inactive (dead)` with no log entries for this boot.

`home-units.service` fixes this for every unit in your home directory, not
just webterm, in Game Mode and Desktop Mode. It is the one piece installed
outside your home directory, so `--home_units` installs it with sudo. It does
so only when your home directory is encrypted, and reinstalls it when the repo
has a newer version. It also removes the files the standalone steamos-config
repo used to install under the old names. To remove it:

```sh
sudo systemctl --global disable home-units.service
sudo rm -f /etc/systemd/user/home-units.service /etc/atomic-update.conf.d/dotfiles.conf
sudo rm -rf /etc/dotfiles
```

What it installs:

Everything this adds to `/etc` is named after the repo (`dotfiles`),
except the unit itself, which must sit where systemd looks for units:

- `/etc/systemd/user/home-units.service`, enabled for all users. Each user
  manager sees it while the home directory is still locked. It runs
  `/etc/dotfiles/home-units-start` (from `steamos/bin/home-units-start`), which
  waits until `~/.config` is readable and runs `systemctl --user daemon-reload`.
  Then, for each `~/.config/systemd/user/<target>.wants/` (and `.requires/`)
  whose target is already up, it starts the units linked there. Nothing else is started, so
  SteamOS's own units that already ran aren't run again. A target that isn't
  up yet, like `graphical-session.target` before Desktop Mode, starts its units
  itself later.
- `/etc/atomic-update.conf.d/dotfiles.conf`, a keep list. Since SteamOS
  3.6 an update drops every change in `/etc` that isn't on a keep list (into
  `/etc/previous`). The default list, `/usr/lib/rauc/atomic-update-keep.conf`,
  covers `/etc/systemd/system` but not `/etc/systemd/user`, so this one names
  the unit, its enablement symlink and `/etc/dotfiles/home-units-start`.

Which units it starts is up to you: `systemctl --user enable foo.service`
adds a link under the target named in the unit's `WantedBy=`, and
`systemctl --user disable` removes it. `journalctl --user -b -u home-units`
shows what it started this boot.

To check it after a reboot: `systemctl --user status home-units.service`
should be `active (exited)` and `webterm.socket` `active (listening)`. To test
that it survives an update, switch branches and update
(`sudo steamos-select-branch beta && sudo steamos-atomupd-client`), reboot,
and check that `/etc/systemd/user/home-units.service` is still there.

## Security

**This is a full shell running as your user.** Anyone who can use the page
can do anything you can.

- It only listens on `127.0.0.1`, and ttyd itself sits on a UNIX socket that
  only your user can open.
- ttyd's `-O` rejects WebSocket connections whose `Origin` doesn't match the
  page's own host.
- `-O` alone doesn't stop DNS rebinding, where a malicious site's domain
  resolves to 127.0.0.1 so the browser treats it as the same origin. That's
  what the random URL token is for. ttyd only serves the terminal under
  `/<token>/` and answers 404 everywhere else, so such a page can't find it.
  Keep the token private, like a password. Setting `WEBTERM_TOKEN=` (empty)
  turns this protection off.
- Don't expose it beyond localhost (port forwarding, reverse proxy,
  `0.0.0.0`) without real authentication and TLS.

## Keeping work with tmux

Bare shells are disposable. A bare shell ends when you close its tab, when
webterm stops on idle, and when you run `~/dotfiles/install.sh --variant steamos --webterm`.

To keep something running, start `tmux` in the terminal. The tmux server
survives all three, and you reattach with `tmux attach` on your next visit.

Why the tmux server survives: everything started from webterm, including a
tmux server, belongs to `webterm-ttyd.service`. By default systemd kills all
of a service's processes when it stops. The unit sets `KillMode=process`, so
on stop systemd signals only ttyd. ttyd then hangs up its shells, which ends
them. tmux detaches and keeps running.

When the service next starts, systemd logs a "left-over process" notice about
the tmux server. That's expected.

## Testing

```sh
python3 steamos/test/smoke.py
```

It needs `steamos/bin/ttyd`, which `--webterm` downloads.

The test needs no running systemd. `systemd-socket-activate` stands in for
`webterm.socket`, and the real ttyd and `systemd-socket-proxyd` do the rest.
It checks that:

- the page is only served under the token,
- a cross-origin WebSocket is rejected,
- the page is the stock page with `steamos/web/tab-keys.html` appended,
- a shell command round-trips, and
- the proxy exits once idle.

It doesn't cover `webterm-ttyd.service` stopping with the proxy, because that
step needs a real systemd.

## Possible future work

Authentication beyond the URL token, TLS, and multi-user support are out of
scope for now.
